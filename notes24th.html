        <h2>Throwback My 24th</h2>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;I want to write about what’s been dominating my brain.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna write a poem.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna paint.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna write a fiction.<br>
            
        <p> Learning how to code is somehow similar to creative writing. Although they are more similar to solve
            mathematical problems. I came to realize that writing essays or even fictions, movie scripts requires logical
            thinking more than I’ve considered it to be. At this stage of my life, I’m trying to focus on one thing. I’ve
            always been distracted with things like relationships, friends or the world outside. I couldn’t sit down and 
            calmly write down shits. I’m unsure that it’s because I’ve just turned to 25 a month ago, and magically my brain 
            stops expanding interests but rather narrowing down and prefers no dramas, accepts the way I had built my
            self... Which also means me getting older? oh boy.</p>
            
        <p> It’s hard to believe myself writing this journal with a hand, for this long, not have a impulsive desire to w
            rite to-do list kinda stuffs. Apparently, writing a journal in second language, not the first, helps me slow 
            down the speed of flows of thought and feelings, makes me try to find more precise words to use, also not too
            sophisticated. I feel like I’m way less harsh on myself when I speak, write and think in English, because my
            English level is not as high as that I can freely express my characteristics, so my aim is mostly headed towa
            rds smoother communication, which is I would say closer to original purpose of using languages. Sometimes, no,
            more than some, most of the times, languages have been evolved from ancient times, so that they contain too m
            any layers behind. I had trouble ignoring their historical, political and cultural meanings. I kept hesitatin
            g saying certain words especially in Korean, which connects me to overthink, which ironically leads me to say
            inappropriate or belated answer or even irrelevant at all. I hope myself being more tolerable in communication
            with others and less judgemental both to myself and others.</p>
            
        <p> What I’ve learned last year is… - ok, I don’t want to sound too simple, but I can’t help stop me being me, I a
            m as simple as it may sound… - to love. Let me give more detailed explain. How to love people in many ways suc
            h as, as a friend, as a stranger, I mean fellow citizen, how to embrace the existence of others. Not being ann
            oyed by them but celebrating our lives. I had been meeting a lot of people from all over the world, they all h
            ave different backgrounds, first languages, therefore diverse ways of thinking. So I’ve, step by step, learned
            not only how to embrace the differences, diversities, but also how to enjoy them.</p>
            
        <p> I’ve met friendly people, rude ones, or smart ones or not that smart ones, as well. I’ve met people through wo
            rk, on streets, while traveling, online, or even reunion with high school friend after 10 years. Consequently 
            I’ve been through lots of farewells. I would like to say that I’m still processing farewells. I am having nigh
            tmares which basically share same scenario, that I’m stuck in the last day in the city and should pack to move
            out. But in many different ways being dragged by people that I’ve known there. I dream the same dream at least
            once in three days so far. I keep going back there but only to the saddest part of the past year. Yes, it’s st
            ressful. However, I want to interpret this in a good way. I feel myself grew up that I made real human connect
            ions and let people come in deep through my heart, so they even reached to my subconscious level.</p>
            
        <p> I’ve never regretted going there after this whole year of journey. Not even once. There were struggles. Having
            no money at all for two weeks, missing family and friends back home, feeling sick of work or people or city it
            self, that I used to want to go back earlier than planned initially. I wandered a lot. I made poor choices too
            many times. But all I keep now in my memories are heartwarming human interactions. I can tell that  now I know
            how to love people and I can proudly declare that I truly LOVE all my friends back there in my second home. (a
            lright.. might not be literally all of them.. but most of them i swear!) This means huge to me considering tha
            t I was not able to say that I love my own family before. (In my defence, I was really confused about the defi
            nition of the word ‘love' and couldn’t understand when people say they love someone.) You might say I overthin
            k and being too serious. I have no intention to dispute.  Back on the topic, even if for those whom I made sho
            rt connections with, every single person that I’ve made contact with has their own spot in my heart, in any sh
            ape inside my body- somewhere in my universe. </p>
            
        <p> These above are what I’ve pondered last three weeks.. being sad and lonely again, depressed and bored again, b
            ut more in positive ways and in gratefulness.</p>
