        <h2>Notes Throwback 24th - 1 24살의 기록 - 1</h2>

        <p> Monday, March 6, 2023.</p>

        <p>I want to write about what’s been dominating my brain.<br>
            I wanna write a poem.<br>
            I wanna paint.<br>
            I wanna write a fiction.<br>
            
        <p> Learning how to code is somehow similar to writing - creative writing. Although they are more alike to solve<br>
            mathematical problems. I came to realize that writing essays or even fictions, movie scripts requires logical<br>
            thinking more than I’ve considered it to be. At this stage of my life, I’m trying to focus on one thing. I’ve<br>
            always been distracted with things like relationships, friends or the world outside. I couldn’t sit down and <br>
            calmly write down shits. I’m unsure that it’s because I’ve just turned to 25 a month ago, and magically my br<br>
            ain stops expanding interests but rather narrowing down and prefers no dramas, accepts the way I had built my<br>
            self... Which also means me getting older? oh boy.</p>
            
        <p> It’s hard to believe myself writing this journal with a hand, for this long, not have a impulsive desire to w<br>
            rite to-do list kinda stuffs. Apparently, writing a journal in second language, not the first, helps me slow <br>
            down the speed of flows of thought and feelings, makes me try to find more precise words to use, also not too<br>
            sophisticated. I feel like I’m way less harsh on myself when I speak, write and think in English, because my<br>
            English level is not as high as that I can freely express my characteristics, so my aim is mostly headed towa<br>
            rds smoother communication, which is I would say closer to original purpose of using languages. Sometimes, no,<br>
            more than some, most of the times, languages have been evolved from ancient times, so that they contain too m<br>
            any layers behind. I had trouble ignoring their historical, political and cultural meanings. I kept hesitatin<br>
            g saying certain words especially in Korean, which connects me to overthink, which ironically leads me to say<br>
            inappropriate or belated answer or even irrelevant at all. I hope myself being more tolerable in communication<br>
            with others and less judgemental both to myself and others.</p>
            
        <p> What I’ve learned last year is… - ok, I don’t want to sound too simple, but I can’t help stop me being me, I a<br>
            m as simple as it may sound… - to love. Let me give more detailed explain. How to love people in many ways suc<br>
            h as, as a friend, as a stranger, I mean fellow citizen, how to embrace the existence of others. Not being ann<br>
            oyed by them but celebrating our lives. I had been meeting a lot of people from all over the world, they all h<br>
            ave different backgrounds, first languages, therefore diverse ways of thinking. So I’ve, step by step, learned<br>
            not only how to embrace the differences, diversities, but also how to enjoy them.</p>
            
        <p> I’ve met friendly people, rude ones, or smart ones or not that smart ones, as well. I’ve met people through wo<br>
            rk, on streets, while traveling, online, or even reunion with high school friend after 10 years. Consequently <br>
            I’ve been through lots of farewells. I would like to say that I’m still processing farewells. I am having nigh<br>
            tmares which basically share same scenario, that I’m stuck in the last day in the city and should pack to move<br>
            out. But in many different ways being dragged by people that I’ve known there. I dream the same dream at least<br>
            once in three days so far. I keep going back there but only to the saddest part of the past year. Yes, it’s st<br>
            ressful. However, I want to interpret this in a good way. I feel myself grew up that I made real human connect<br>
            ions and let people come in deep through my heart, so they even reached to my subconscious level.</p>
            
        <p> I’ve never regretted going there after this whole year of journey. Not even once. There were struggles. Having<br>
            no money at all for two weeks, missing family and friends back home, feeling sick of work or people or city it<br>
            self, that I used to want to go back earlier than planned initially. I wandered a lot. I made poor choices too<br>
            many times. But all I keep now in my memories are heartwarming human interactions. I can tell that  now I know<br>
            how to love people and I can proudly declare that I truly LOVE all my friends back there in my second home. (a<br>
            lright.. might not be literally all of them.. but most of them i swear!) This means huge to me considering tha<br>
            t I was not able to say that I love my own family before. (In my defence, I was really confused about the defi<br>
            nition of the word ‘love' and couldn’t understand when people say they love someone.) You might say I overthin<br>
            k and being too serious. I have no intention to dispute.  Back on the topic, even if for those whom I made sho<br>
            rt connections with, every single person that I’ve made contact with has their own spot in my heart, in any sh<br>
            ape inside my body- somewhere in my universe. </p>
            
        <p> These above are what I’ve pondered last three weeks.. being sad and lonely again, depressed and bored again, b<br>
            ut more in positive ways and in gratefulness.</p>
